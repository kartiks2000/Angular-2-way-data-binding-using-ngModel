# Angular-2-way-data-binding-without-ngModel


2-way-binding using "ngModel".
    ngModel is a inbuild implementaion of combination of property binding and event binding.
    to use ngModel we need to import "FormsModule" from '@angular/forms' and need to register it in the imports in the imports in the root component that is the app component "app.module.ts".
